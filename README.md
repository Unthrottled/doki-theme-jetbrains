This plugin is for serious Otaku programmers.
Code with your waifu. With over **30** themes,
I think you will find best girl.

You can choose themes from various, Anime, Manga, or Visual Novels:

- DanganRonpa
- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Fate
- Gate
- High School DxD
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba
- Love Live!
- Lucky Star
- Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid
- Neon Genesis Evangelion
- OreGairu
- Re:Zero
- Steins Gate
- Sword Art Online

Sticker in the way? No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.

These themes are easy to install, there are minimal configurations, so you can enjoy the themes faster.
They also play well with other themes, so feel free to come and go as your mood changes :)
